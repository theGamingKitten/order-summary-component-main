## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

- Getting better with using Tailwind CSS. Didn't have to look up classes that much compared to first project with Tailwind CSS.

### Continued development

- Will use Tailwind CSS more to get even more comfortable with using it especially with projects that need more CSS and more complex responsive designs.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS docs](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Documentation for Tailwind CSS
